<p>Once that is in place, find the card for the repository you want to enable beta releases for, and click repository card to get to the repository page and then click the 3 dots in top right corner to bring up the repository menu.</p>
<p>In that menu click on &quot;Redownload&quot; to bring up the Redownload dialog.
