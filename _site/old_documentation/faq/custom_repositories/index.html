<p>But there are a number of different reasons why a developer might not want to publish their repository to HACS, for these situations you can in many cases add it to HACS as a custom repository.</p>
<p>:::warning
Not all repositories will work in HACS, since HACS still needs the repository to have a known structure.
:::</p>
<p>If you want to try and add a custom repository to HACS do the following:</p>
<p><img src="/img/custom_repositories_entry.png" alt="custom_repositories_entry"></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to any of the sections (integrations, frontend, automation).</li>
<li>Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Select &quot;Custom repositories&quot;</li>
<li>Add the URL to the repository.</li>
<li>Select the correct category.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;ADD&quot; button.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/custom_repositories.png" alt="custom_repositories"></p>
<p>:::tip
The &quot;Custom repositories&quot; option might be hidden while background tasks is running to stop the user to break their instance. Wait a while or/and check HACS status.
