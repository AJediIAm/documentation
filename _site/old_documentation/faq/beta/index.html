<p>First you need to have the repository already downloaded and managed by HACS.</p>
<p>Once that is in place, click on the card for the repository you want to enable beta releases for, and click the 3 dots in top right corner to bring up the repository menu.</p>
<p>In that menu click on &quot;Redownload&quot; to bring up the Redownload dialog.

<p><img src="/img/checkmark_beta.png" alt="checkmark_beta"></p>
<p>Activate the checkbox to the left of &quot;Show beta versions&quot;, once you activate that HACS will fetch new information in the background, once that is done you can now <a href="/docs/faq/select_version">select a beta version</a> to download.</p>
<p>:::note</p>
<p>Not all repositories will have beta releases, it is up to the author of the repository to use that.</p>
