<p>To help out with the translation of HACS you need an account on Lokalise, the easiest way to get one is to <a href="https://lokalise.com/login/">click here</a> then select &quot;Log in with GitHub&quot;.</p>
<p>When you have created your account <a href="https://lokalise.com/public/854515055f679055040b37.42677693/">click here to join the HACS project on Lokalise.</a></p>
<p>If you are unsure on how to proceed their documentation is really good, and you can <a href="https://docs.lokalise.com/en/">find that here.</a> or send me a message @ <a href="https://discord.gg/apgchf8">discord</a> (username: <code>ludeeus#4212</code>)</p>
<p>Before each release new translations are pulled from Lokalise, so if you have added something look for it in the next version of HACS.</p>
<p>If you add elements to the UI of HACS that needs translations, update the <a href="https://github.com/hacs/frontend/blob/master/src/localize/languages/en.json"><code>en.json</code></a> file, when your PR are merged those new keys will be added to Lokalise ready to be translated.</p>
