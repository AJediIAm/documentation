<p>The documentation site for HACS is build with <a href="https://docusaurus.io">Docusaurus</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></p>
<h2>Contribute to the documentation</h2>
<p>There are two ways of contributing to the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the &quot;Edit this page&quot; link at the bottom of every page.</li>
<li>Locally changing (devcontainer)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All changes to the documentation should go against the <code>master</code> branch.</em><br>
The repository for the documentation is hosted @ https://github.com/hacs/documentation</p>
<h3>Edit this page</h3>
<p>When you see something that needs changing when you browse the documentation, scroll down to the bottom of the page you are looking at, and click the &quot;Edit this page&quot; link.</p>
<p><img src="/img/edit_this.png" alt="edit"></p>
<p>This will take you to the GitHub page for it so you can change the content.</p>
<h3>Locally changing (devcontainer)</h3>
<p>First spin up the <a href="/docs/developer/devcontainer">devcontainer</a></p>
<p>When you have that running issue the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn start
</code></pre>
<p>You have now started a local webserver that hosts the documentation on http://localhost:3000</p>
<p>That server will reload if you do changes to the documentation so you can live see how the changes look.</p>
<p>When you are happy with the result, push the changes to your fork and create a PR to have it merged to the HACS base.</p>
