<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers">The easiest way to contribute is to spin up a devcontainer</a> with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It has all the tools you need included, and it does not interfere with your system.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>VS Code</li>
<li>Remote - Containers (VS Code extension)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open a cloned repository:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/hacs">the HACS repository</a> that you want to contribute to.</li>
<li>Clone the repository to your computer.</li>
<li>Open the repository using VS Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you open this repository with VS code you are asked to &quot;Reopen in Container&quot;. This will start the build of the container.</p>
<p><em>If you don't see this notification, open the command pallet and select  <code>Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container</code></em></p>
