<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/hacs/integration/issues">First lets start out by stating that <em>ALL</em> issues should be reported here</a></strong></p>
<h1>What should be in the issue?</h1>
<p>When you create an issue in the repository for HACS, you start by selecting a template.</p>
<p>All templates have a defined structure and it is <strong>expected</strong> that you follow it.</p>
<p><em>Issues that are missing required information can (will) be closed.</em></p>
<h2>Flag</h2>
<p>This should <strong>only</strong> be used, when there is grounds for removing (blacklisting) a repository in HACS.</p>
<p>When you are flagging a repository you need to supply at least these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good description for why.</li>
<li>The name of the repository.</li>
<li>Proof that you have tried to contact the owner of that repository (link to issue)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are flagging it because you don't like it, have issues with it, or it's not working, you should report that to the repository and not here.</em></p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>You use this when you have issues with HACS.</p>
<p><a href="https://hacs.xyz/docs/basic/logs">To enable debug logs for HACS (required when adding an issue) have a look here</a>.</p>
<p>Logs are <strong>more</strong> then <em>just</em> errors, with debug logging it gives the person investigating the issue a full picture of what happened.</p>
<p><strong>What an issue should contain depends on the type, but at least:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A GOOD description of the issue.</li>
<li>Debug logs.</li>
<li>Steps to reproduce the issue.</li>
<li>If the issue is in the UI, add screenshots.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/basic/diagnostics">Diagnostics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see examples of good/bad issues further down on this page.</p>
