<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>For a plugin repository to be valid these are the requirements:</p>
<h3>Repository structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are <code>.js</code> files under <code>ROOT_OF_THE_REPO/dist/</code> or directly in the root of the repository.</li>
<li>One of the <code>.js</code> files have the same name as the repository.
<ul>
<li>With every rule there is an exception, if the repository's name starts with <code>&quot;lovelace-&quot;</code>, there can be a <code>.js</code> file in the repository matching the repository name with <code>&quot;lovelace-&quot;</code> striped from the name, example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-yml">Repository name: &quot;lovelace-awesome-card&quot;
File name of one of the files: &quot;awesome-card.js&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When searching for accepted files HACS will look in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>dist</code>directory.</li>
<li>On the latest release.</li>
<li>The root of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>All <code>.js</code> files it finds in the first location it finds one that matches the name will be downloaded.</p>
<p>If your plugin require files that are not <code>js</code> files, place all files (including the card file) in the <code>dist</code> directory.</p>
<h3>GitHub releases (optional)</h3>
<h4>If there are releases</h4>
<p>When downloading/upgrading it will scan the content in the latest release.</p>
<p>If there are multiple releases in the repository the user have some options to download a specific version.
The choices will be the last 5 releases and the default branch.</p>
<h4>If there are no releases</h4>
<p>It will scan files in the branch marked as default.</p>
