<p>Repositories can be removed from the default pool of repositories for any number of reasons, some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's abandoned</li>
<li>It breaks Home Assistant</li>
<li>It steals credentials</li>
<li>It's deleted/removed</li>
</ul>
<p>:::warning
If you as a maintainer delete/remove the GitHub repository that is added to HACS as a default repository, all your default repositories will be removed from HACS and you will not be able to add any more in the future.</p>
<p>So if you plan to do that, first create a PR to have it removed from HACS.
