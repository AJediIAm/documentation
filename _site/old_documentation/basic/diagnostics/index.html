<ol>
<li>First to the integrations dashboard in the Home Assistant UI</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integrations.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show your integrations."></a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then click on the 3 dots in the bottom right corner of the card for HACS, and select &quot;Download diagnostics&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/download_diagnostics.png" alt="download diagnostics"></p>
