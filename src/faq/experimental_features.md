title: Experimental features
---
HACS does not do beta releases (anymore), instead we have experimental features.
These features are not enabled by default, and you have to enable them manually.

Experimental features will (generally) **not** be documented, and will be changed or removed without notice (outside of relese notes).

## Enabling experimental features

To enable experimental features, fir go to your [Integration panel](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/)

1. Click "CONFIGURE" on the HACS card.
2. Add a checkmark in the "Enable experimental features" checkbox.
3. Click "SUBMIT".
